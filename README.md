# Thesis-Code
Code I wrote to perform the simulation experiment in my undergraduate thesis. The code is written in the R programming language. The files are: 
  The Hypothesis Tests script, (hypothesisIntervals file)
  the Threshold Search and Selection Algorithm, (gibbsThreshSearch file) 
  the proposed Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm for the extreme value generating process (sample simulations in this experiment), (RWmetropolis file)
  Frechet, Pareto, Log-Logistic and Mixture (Gamma-Pareto) simlations, (simulation files)
  the Goodness of Fit tests for each sample and results (GFTsimulations file)

The random variables are: 
    X ~ Frechet sample
    Y ~ Pareto sample
    Z ~ Log-Logistic sample
    W ~ Mixture sample

The script runs on the saved simulations; nevertheless, it's possible to carry out multiple simulation experiments, but the scripts presented here are the ones used to obtain the results presented in the thesis.
